I am a Computer Science undergraduate currently learning full-stack development. I have completed two internships and have approximately one year of experience working remotely on full-stack projects.

## Goals

1. Building **automated loom-style video** generation tool for client outreach for **everyone**. Soon!
2. Learning "more `typescript` (never ends!)" and `Rust`.
3. Reading a book `designing-data-intensive-applications`

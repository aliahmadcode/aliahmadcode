I am a Computer Science undergraduate currently learning full-stack development. I have completed two internships and have approximately one year of experience working remotely on full-stack projects. Due to my study schedule, I am currently freelancing part-time to utilize my skills.

## Goals

1. Building **automated loom-style video** generation tool for client outreach for **everyone**. Soon!
2. Learning "more typescript (never ends!)" and Rust.
